                    <hr /><h1>Why should you choose Quality Engineering Design and Manufacturing Course from IIT KGP?</h1><hr />
                    <h2>Course Overview</h2><br />
                    <div class="well lefted">
                        <br />
                        <p>In case you are wondering, Quality Engineering Design and Manufacturing is a relatively new dual degree course started by IIT Kharagpur in 2011.<br />
                            You will be awarded a B.Tech in Engineering Product Design and Manufacturing and M.Tech in Design and Quality Engineering.<br />                          
                            The main motto to start the course is to provide students with exposure to engineering design, manufacturing, and quality topics related to mechanical products like automotive systems or electrical products like embedded systems.<br />
                            </p>
                    </div>
                    <hr /><h2>How does the course work?</h2><br />
                    <div class="well lefted">
                        <br />
                        <p>After the first year, the students will be divided into 2 groups - Industrial Electronics Vertical and Mechanical Engineering Vertical. In case you donâ€™t know, in IIT KGP students in the first year will all be studying common courses, you will be starting your departmental courses only after your first year. 
                            <br />Irrespective of the vertical you are choosing, you will be provided with a strong foundation in design, manufacturing, analytics, supply chain, and management by the Industrial and Systems Department Courses.                            
                            <br /><br />As the course is offered only to mere 15 students, most of the courses will be happening along with the other department students. As this is an interdisciplinary program from 3 departments, both the vertical students will be having classes with the Industrial and Systems Engineering Department, which is our main department.                           
                            <br /><br />And then the mechanical engineering students will have classes with the mechanical department, similarly, electronics vertical students will have classes with the electrical and electronics department students.

                    <div class="well lefted">
                        <ul>
                            <li>We are the only branch in IIT KGP to be provided with 2 internships - a compulsory 2-month internship at the end of 3rd year and a compulsory 6-month internship during your 8 th semester. This provides the students with inhand industrial experience of their interest.</li>
                            <li>As there is a 6-month internship during your 8 th semester, this provides you with a great opportunity to grab a pre-placement offer to start your career. (Many of the students have already been given a job offer after their 6-month internship in the companies)</li>
                            <li>Interdisciplinary courses offered by a variety of departments - electives(non-departmental courses) can provide to us by many departments - Computer Science, Electronics Engineering, Vinod Gupta School of Management, Rajendra Mishra School of Entrepreneurship, etc.. You are given a free choice to choose your elective from any of these departments.</li>
                            <li>All the important core courses and labs which are given to the electrical department students are added in the curricula of the industrial electronics vertical students. The same is the case for mechanical vertical students.</li>
