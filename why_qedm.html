                            <li>5-year Dual degree program that offers B.Tech + M.Tech in Quality Engineering Design and Manufacturing. Started in 2013.</li>
                            <li>Offers 2 verticals: Mechanical and Industrial Electronics. Students have to choose the vertical at the end of first year.</li>
                            <li>Courses from the Industrial and Systems Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Electronics and Electrical Communications Engineering and Mechanical Engineering Departments are covered in the course. Students get enough opportunities to explore interests in multiple fields</li>
                            <li>A 6-months internship during the 8th semester is a unique feature. Across all the branches at IIT Kharagpur, only QEDM students get the opportunity to sit for CDC Internships twice. By the end of the course, a QEDM student has a minimum of 8 months' work experience.</li>
                            <!-- <li>Due to being a relatively new and small branch, QEDM students face difficulty of creating awareness about the branch. Companies that come for CDC, look for 2 month pre-final year interns. But the off-campus opportunities for the students are plenty.</li> -->
                            <li>Placements record of QEDM has been 100% for the past two years with students being placed in companies like JP Morgan Chase, Nutanix, Texas Instruments, Bidgeley, ZS Associates, PWC, Standard Chartered, Robert Bosch, Barclays, EXL, Sprinklr and Adrosonic. QEDM students are now eligible to apply in highest number of companies during placements, only after Computer Science and Engineering, Electronics and Electrical Communications Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computing, and Instrumentation Engineering.</li>
                            <li>The inter-disciplinary specialisations of Financial Engineering and Entrepreneurship Engineering aren't applicable for the branch. But department change is possible in accordance with the institute policy of dual degree courses.</li>

                        <br />
                        <p>Industrial Electronics curriculum covers most of the core subjects and labs of Electrical Engineering branch until 7th Semester. Ample research opportunities in fields such as Embedded Systems, Control Systems, Power Electronics, and Electrical Machines. <br />
                        Industrial Electronics students can easily pursue a Minor in Computer Science and Engineering, Electronics and Electrical Communications Engineering, and Instrumentation Engineering due to large overlap of core subjects with the minor curricula. <br />
                        Microspecialisations which can be completed easily include Embedded Wireless Systems, Entrepreneurship & Innovation, and Embedded Control, Software, Modeling and Design.
                        <hr />Mechanical Engineering vertical has almost all core subjects and laboratories of Mechanical Engineering. The possible research areas are Quality Engineering, Geometric Modeling and other mechanical core subjects. Though the courses only provide introductory knowledge and solid knowledge base is required by an individual in their own capacity.<br />
