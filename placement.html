                    Proud to say that the number of placements and internships we are grabbing through our Career Development Centre( CDC is the placement and internship cell of IIT KGP)  has only been increasing since the start of the course in 2011.<br /><br />
                    Our seniors have grabbed internships and placements in various companies including ITC, General Motors, BOSCH, Honeywell, TVS Motors, TATA Motors, Siemens, Tata Steel, Ather Energy, American Express, Credit Suisse, ZS Associates, TCS Innovation Labs, etc.<br /><br />
                    In recent years, we have also been allowed to sit for the companies which are opening specifically for mechanical or electrical engineering students. This will provide you a great increase in opportunity.<br /><br />
                    The average / median CTC does not provide the right image of our branch, as there are a mere 14 students in every batch of the year. But if you are interested, the average CTC for our branch has always been around 9-10 Lakhs per annum for the past 2-3 years.<br />

                    The course load is relatively high for our department as compared to other departments as we have one semester full of internships during our 4th year. On average, we will be having 23-24 hours of classes every week which is not too high, when compared to other department students having 20-21 hours of class. But many of our seniors have successfully been able to grab interns and placements in non - core fields like Software Development, Data Analytics, Financial Analyst, etc.<br /><br />
                    Some of the companies our seniors have placed or interned include Mathworks, ZS Associates, Honeywell, American Express, Credit Suisse, etc.<br /><br />
                    A similar course named Engineering Design provided by IIT Madras has also seen a steady increase in placement and research opportunities during the past 5 years.

                        <p>Industrial Electronics curriculum covers most of the core subjects and labs of Electrical Engineering branch until 7th Semester. Ample research opportunities in fields such as Embedded Systems, Control Systems, Power Electronics, and Electrical Machines. <br />
                        Industrial Electronics students can easily pursue a Minor in Computer Science and Engineering, Electronics and Electrical Communications Engineering, and Instrumentation Engineering due to large overlap of core subjects with the minor curricula. <br />
                        Microspecialisations which can be completed easily include Embedded Wireless Systems, Entrepreneurship & Innovation, and Embedded Control, Software, Modeling and Design.
                        <hr />Mechanical Engineering vertical has almost all core subjects and laboratories of Mechanical Engineering. The possible research areas are Quality Engineering, Geometric Modeling and other mechanical core subjects. Though the courses only provide introductory knowledge and solid knowledge base is required by an individual in their own capacity.<br />
                        <hr />Some of the students have even successfully joined many international universities like the University of Southern California, the University of Alberta, the University of Warwick, Warwick Manufacturing Group, Yuan Ze University for their higher studies.<hr />
